            <p>I have compelted two codepath certificates,
                 one in <strong>Intermediate Web Development</strong> and one in <strong>Intermediate Techinical Interview Prep</strong>.
                 From these course I was able to create <b>2</b> main projects on the side. <em>RoamMates</em> and <em>fitpal</em>
                 are the titles of them. Prior to taking my CSE 134B class I would always try to <code>div</code> everything out.

        <pre>
           But I have definitely learned
           from my mistaks and now am ready to create projects  
           without so many divs! I am also learning how to add 

           components to websites   that are used in the real world!
